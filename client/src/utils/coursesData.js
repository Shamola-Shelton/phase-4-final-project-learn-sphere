        notes: "Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks. A program is written in a programming language, which provides rules (syntax) for writing code. Programming allows us to automate tasks, solve problems, and build applications like websites, games, and mobile apps.",

        notes: "Control structures guide the flow of a program. Conditional statements (like if-else) let the program make decisions, while loops (like for and while) repeat actions until conditions are met. Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks, making programs organized and reducing repetition.",

        notes: "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style based on objects, which group related data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Key concepts include classes (blueprints for objects), inheritance (sharing features between classes), encapsulation (hiding details), and polymorphism (using one method in different ways). Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code.",
        summary: "OOP = objects with classes and inheritance; Debugging = fixing code errors.",
